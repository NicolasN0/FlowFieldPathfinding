# FlowFields
Research topic
# Intro

A flow field is simply said a sample space that returns a velocity at every position. We will focus on a 2D grid where every field will return a veloctiy.
These velocities will depend on attraction or repulsion from certain entities/actions.

Flow fields are a powerful pathfinding/steering behaviour technique in some cases. 
A few of these cases are,
- you have a large amount of agents going to the same position.
- the environment is highly dynamic
- the position of the agents need to be constantly changed
